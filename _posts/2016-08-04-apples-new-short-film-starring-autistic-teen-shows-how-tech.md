  Dillan Barmache can't speak, but that doesn't mean he doesn't have anything to
  say. In fact, Dillan has complex and powerful thoughts, and thanks to easily
  accessible technology paired with innovative apps, you can hear his
  perspective. Dillan, who is autistic and nonverbal, is the star of a new short
  film created by Apple to celebrate Autism Acceptance Day.
